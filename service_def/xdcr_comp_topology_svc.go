//of xdcr component topology - xdcr components in a cluster running on which nodes;
//what are the port numbers for the admin port of xdcr component; which kv node that
//a xdcr component is responsible for.
//
//This interface is trying to be deployment agnostic. It doesn't assume if xdcr component
//and kv node are coexist on the same physical host or not.
//
//An implementation of this interface is likely to be deployment dependent. Base on the
//deployment mode, xdcr solution can choose to use the proper implementation class
