# XDCR Developer Tools

Some tools to allow developers quickly get up and running on local cluster_run environments
# Pre-Requisites
The tools require Bash 4 or above. Version 5 is recommended.

# 1-Step Provisioning
The provisioning script of `provision_clusterRun.sh` provide the basic framework for provisioning a 2 1-node cluster. 
It expects:
   - Users to run cluster_run with 2 *clean* nodes setup.

It will:
  - Setup the 2 nodes into 2 1-node clusters.
  - Create bucket(s) on each of the cluster.
  - Create bi-directional replications between them.
  - Run data generator load on the buckets.

# Provisioning Customization
The magic happens all in the `clusterRunProvisioning.shlib`. Users are free to create their own provisioning scripts. See `examples` directory for an example of a customized script.
## Customization Variables
The following globals are used to provision the system:

| Variable Name              | Purpose                                                      | Type              | Key          | Value                     |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| DEFAULT_ADMIN              | The username with which to set up the cluster                | String            | N/A          | Specified string          |
| DEFAULT_PW                 | The password with which to set up the cluster                | String            | N/A          | Specified String          |
| CLUSTER_NAME_PORT_MAP      | Maps a cluster name to a port of cluster_run                 | Associative Array | Cluster Name | Port Number               |
| CLUSTER_NAME_XDCR_PORT_MAP | Maps a cluster name to the internal XDCR Port of cluster_run | Associative Array | Cluster Name | XDCR Port number          |
| CLUSTER_NAME_BUCKET_MAP    | Maps a cluster to an array of bucket names that it will have | Associative Array | Cluster Name | Array of Bucket names     |
| BUCKET_NAME_SCOPE_MAP      | Maps a bucket to a list of scope names that it will have.    | Associative Array | Bucket Name  | Array of Scope names      |
| SCOPE_NAME_COLLECTION_MAP  | Maps a scope to one or more collections that it should have  | Associative Array | Scope Name   | Array of Collection names |

### Setting Bucket Properties
Setting bucket properties is a little special since it requires a hack around bash to work with a hash of hashes. There is no one visible global to use, but special functions are used, as follows:
```
declare -A BucketProperty=(["ramQuotaMB"]=100)
declare -A Bucket1Properties=(["ramQuotaMB"]=100 ["CompressionMode"]="Active")
insertPropertyIntoBucketNamePropertyMap "B0" BucketProperty
insertPropertyIntoBucketNamePropertyMap "B1" Bucket1Properties
```
The above snippet shows how to set bucket properties, and the provisioning script will set up the buckets with the appropriate properties.

# Exporting Topologies of Live XDCR-provisioned
The provisioning script provides users a way to establish a continuous CLI environment after a provisioning script.
As long as the function "exportProvisionedConfig" is called at the end of any provisioning scripts, any live-XDCR helper scripts below will function.
The function exports provisioned variables into a temporary file in the local tools directory, which is then read in by the helper files.

# Live-XDCR Helper Scripts
The following is a list of helper scripts that are bundled in this tool directory.

## internalSettings.sh
Allows the editing of XDCR internal settings of a provisioned cluster.
```
./internalSettings.sh [-h] -l | -g <ClusterName> | -s <ClusterName> -v "key=val" [-v... ]
	h: This help page
	l: List all available <clusterName> for setting and displaying
	g: Gets all internal settings for cluster <clusterName>
	s: Sets internal setting on cluster <clusterName> with one or more values of "key=val"
```

## defaultReplicationSettings.sh
Edits the default replication settings of a provisioned cluster.
```
./defaultReplicationSettings.sh [-h] -l | -g <ClusterName> | -s <ClusterName> -v "key=val" [-v... ]
	h: This help page
	l: List all available <clusterName> for setting and displaying
	g: Gets all default replication settings for cluster <clusterName>
	s: Sets default replication setting on cluster <clusterName> with one or more values of "key=val"

Example: ./defaultReplicationSettings.sh -s C1 -v "compressionType=None"
And all future replications will have default of compressionType of None for cluster "C1"
```

## replicationSettings.sh
Edits a specific live replication setting. 
```
./replicationSettings.sh [-h] -l | -g <ID> | -s <ID> -v "key=val" [-v...]
	h: This help page
	l: List all ID and configurations
	g: Gets all replication settings for specified <ID>
	s: Sets replication settings for specified <ID> with one or more values of "key=val"

Example: ./replicationSettings.sh -s 1 -v "filterExpression=" -v "filterSkipRestream=true"
```

## collectionsManagement.sh
Provides a quick and easy way to view/create/delete scopes and collections
```
./collectionsManagement.sh [-h] -l | -g <ClusterName> -b <bucketName> | -n/-d <ClusterName> -b <bucketName> -s <ScopeName> [-c <CollectionName>]
	h: This help page
	l: List all available <clusterName> for setting and displaying
	b: Bucket name to operate on
	g: Gets all collections for cluster <clusterName>
	n: Creates a *new* collection or scope on a cluster
	d: Deletes a collection or scope on a cluster
	s: Specifies a scope
	c: (optional) Specifies a collection under a scope
```
